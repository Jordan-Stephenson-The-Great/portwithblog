I﻿f you ask 5 people what a product manager is, you might get 6 different answers, Some people say a product manager is a mini-CEO. Others say they're the advocate for the customer. Some say they are the glue that holds the team together. Some people say they're responsible for strategy, while others focus on user research and execution.

> T﻿he PM role is about **outcomes,** not *output*

W﻿hy so many answers? For onew thing, the role is complex and multi-faceted. For another, the really is different at different companies. Product management is a 'whitespace' role -the PM is responsible for anything that isn't covered by other people. Some PMs work with dedicated researchers, data scientists, product marketers, and copy-writers, while others have none of these. 



H﻿ere is my answer to what a product manager is: 

> A﻿ PM is the person on a product team who is responsible for choosing the right problems to go after, defining what success looks like, and guiding their team to achieve successful outcomes.

M﻿y responsible for making sure everyone's vision is aligned, all parts fit together, and that nothing slips through the cracks. 

> Y﻿ou must lead without authority, influencing people by using vision, research and analysis.
