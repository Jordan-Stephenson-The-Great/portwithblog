The discovery process is when you figure out what problem you should go after. During the discovery, you take the initial idea and expand your understanding of the customer's needs, problems and goals.

> L﻿ooks for a problem that's large enough to be worth solving, while feasable enough for your team to be successful 

## Why do products fail?

M﻿any launches fail because the team focused on the wrong problems. 

* They misunderstood critical details of what the customer had told them
* The pain of the problem wasn't big enough to overcome inertia
* M﻿issed the bigger picture and only solved part of the problem

> W﻿ithout product discovery, you're just hoping that the first idea you come up with, or that your executive told you to build, is a good solution for an important customer problem
